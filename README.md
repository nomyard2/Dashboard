This is a sample dashboard page for any website.

To-do:
    -Page does not cover the whole screen
    -Icons to add more detail
    -Left side of the "mission" cards have a vertical line of color on the left side of it

Achieved:
    -Use Grid to built a website with a template-first mindset
    -Decorated buttons and seach bar
    -Utilize less "pure" values, like 30px, in place of 30%
